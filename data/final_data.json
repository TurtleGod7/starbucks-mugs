There was an assumption that other \u201cerror\u201d mugs didn\u2019t make it to stores or were destroyed before the release, however a photo of Starbucks Been There Louisiana mug has just been revealed in the Facebook community.\n\nLook closer at the back of the mug, it says \u201cLaissez bons temps rouler\u201d (Cajun French) that is literally translated from the English expression \u201cLet the good times roll.\u201d Well, the right phrase should be \u201cLaissez les bons temps rouler\u201d, which means Starbucks missed \u201cles\u201d word and is now going to replace the mug with the \u201cfixed\u201d one.\u2026 Read more \n",
